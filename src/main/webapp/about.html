	<h1>Cape Cod's Premiere Charity Kiteboarding Race</h1>
	
	
	<p><h2>Cape Crusade Mission:</h2>Kiteboarders harness the elements for sport, but we all take much more from the beaches we visit.  Call it mental clarify or spiritual, energy or renewal, for all of us it is therapeutic.  We challenge our community to help share these benefits with those who have survived cancer.  
	<p>Our logo represents our commitment to fight for what we believe in. It combines the ocean, always full of uncertainty and joy, with a shield to protect us from opposition; and when spun among the waters we ride, a cape to remind us of the superhuman strength it takes for those dealing with cancer.
	<h2>Athlete's for Cancer</h2>
	<p>The Cape Crusade endeavors to support the amazing work that Athlete’s 4 Cancer started back in 2007.  “Athletes 4 Cancer is dedicated to enriching lives impacted by cancer through the healing power of the elements and the tenacity of the human spirit. Essentially, Athletes 4 Cancer rebuilds lives after cancer.  We use adventure-based experiences such as surfing, outrigger canoeing, standup paddling, skiing and snowboarding, as channels of healing, achievement and life-renewal that treat the mind, body, and soul. Athletes 4 Cancer’s programs aim to help young survivors not just survive, but thrive in all aspects of life, inspiring others facing cancer to do the same.” -Athletes 4 Cancer 
	<p>
	<p>In addition to supporting Athletes 4 Cancer 20% of proceeds will be donated to a local Cape Cod Charity.  Working locally and having an impact globally is at the core of our mission.

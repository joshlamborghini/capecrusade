	<p><h2>6 Tips to elevate your fundraising</h2>
	<p>
	Breakdown the numbers: 5 members of your team. Each person gets 10 people to donate $20 and you'll have already met goal. People are very used to being solicted for supporting different races and walks, but now you can have a chance to introduce them to our sport and the community that makes us so unique!
	<p>
	<p>
	<p>
	#1 Start fundraising early
	<ul>Timing is everything. We don't want people to just hit goals; we want them to exceed them!</ul>
	<p>
	<p>
	#2 Lose your inhibition to ask people for money  
	<ul>Getting over this hurdle is one of the most important steps to getting started. You're not asking for money, you're asking them to make an impact. Recognize that this is truly a selfless act that will benefit others and be proud. Others will appreciate and respect your enthusiasm for the cause.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<p>
	#3 Find your personal connection to the cause
	<ul>To be an effective advocate for Athletes 4 Cancer, you must have conviction about the work it does and the people who benefit from it. Some have very direct links to the cause.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<p>
	#4 Craft a compelling message
	<ul>Your message has to be impactful and explain why you are raising money for Athletes 4 Cancer and why the charity deserves it. Let the strength of your story draw the appropriate donations. And remember to ask them to forward the request on to others who may support the cause.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<p>
	#5 Leverage social media
	<ul>Tell your story on Facebook and Twitter. People will "like" and retweet your story to others who may donate.
	</ul>
	<p>
	<p>
	#6 Send a personalized thank-you note to every contributor
	<ul>Make sure that everyone who makes a donation receives a personal word of thanks from you. The core message must convey the gratitude for and impact of their contribution. Use a photo from the event in your thank-you!
	</ul>

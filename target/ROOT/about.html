	<h1>Cape Cod's Premiere Charity Kiteboarding Race</h1>
	
	
	<p><h2>Mission:</h2>Kiteboarders harness the elements for sport, but we all take much more from the beaches we visit.  Call it mental clarify or spiritual, energy or renewal, for all of us it is therapeutic.  We challenge our community to help share these benefits with those who have survived cancer.  
	<p>
	<p>The Cape Crusade endeavors to support the amazing work that Athlete’s 4 Cancer started back in 2007.   Athletes 4 Cancer’s mission is to renew, rebuild, and restart lives after cancer through outdoor adventure. The success of cancer research through the years has led to a greater need to focus on survivorship as more patients are being treated effectively and living longer from diagnosis. Athletes 4 Cancer draws patients in remission aged 18-39 from across the country to participate in their programs.
	<p>
	<p>In addition to supporting Athletes 4 Cancer 20% of proceeds will be donated to a local Cape Cod Charity.  Working locally and having an impact globally is at the core of our mission.
	<p>
	<p><h2>Participation:</h2>There are many ways to participate in this great event, as a racer, sponsor, spectator, or volunteer!  The event centers around a 26 mile relay race but is sure to have activities for people of all ages/abilities!
